function [xJoy, yJoy, e] = readJoy(s)
    
    % Read joystick input by sending a joy read command to the
    % Arduino and then calling the readSerial() function to receive
    % the data.
    
    % External Variables
    % @ s                   - Serial object.
    
    % Internal Variables
    % @ axis                - Number of axis of data to read (e.g. x & y)
    
    % Internal Functions
    % @ readSerial()        - Read data sent by Arduino over serial.
